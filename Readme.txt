*Instructions to execute project code*

This project is supported by two stage code implementation, and below instructions are to be followed for both stages.


Stage1: Machine learning Model development (Five individual and two ensemble machine learning models to be build and training, testing, performance evaluation is to be performed) Steps to execute the code is mentioned below.

Step1: Open 'Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb' in Jupyter notebook.
Step2: Execute entire code.

Stage2: Develop web application to support developed machine learning model. Steps to execute the code are mentioned below.

Step1: Copy 'model.joblib', 'scaler.joblib', 'Diabetes_prediction_app.py', and folder '.streamlit'  in a same folder within local repository.
Step2: Launch command prompt and navigate to the folder containing items stated in Step1.
Step3: Write command 'streamlit run Diabetes_prediction_app.py' and hit enter.
Step4: Web application will be launched in localhost and URL to launch the same will be displayed
Step5: Use the URL to launch the application.
Step6: Web application will be displayed with all the content.
Step7: Select parameters related to patients health condition using slider on left side panel.
Step8: Click find result button and prediction will be displayed.
